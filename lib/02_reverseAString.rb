# Challenge 2 - Reverse a string
#
# Reverse a string in place. In other words, do not create a new string or use other methods on the string such as reverse.
# The goal of the problem is to use a loop and the string accessors to figure out which values to swap for other values. Below is some sample output.
#
# Enter a string:
# reverse_me
# em_esrever

def reverse(string)
  stringArr = string.split('')
  stringArr.each_index.map{|i| stringArr[-1-i]}
end

puts reverse('reverse_me').join
